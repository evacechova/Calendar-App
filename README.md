# Calendar-App

- made in Vanilla JS
- some features are not yet functional:
    -- days are not marked correctly for events spanning across several months
    -- the form for creating new events does display event info at the bottom of the calendar, but only until the user clicks on a different day in the calendar or switches months
    -- there is currently no validation preventing the event end date from preceeding the start date
    -- I would like for the default event start date to be set to the day that the user marked before clicking on the Create Event button
    -- ideally, the divs for days should be generated dynamically so as to prevent extra divs from forming an empty row at the bottom of the calendar
